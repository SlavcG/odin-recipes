    <h2>What is Butter Chicken?</h2>

    <p>Butter chicken, traditionally known as murgh makhani, is an Indian dish originating in New Delhi. <br> It is a type of curry made from chicken with a spiced tomato and butter (makhan) sauce. Its sauce <br> is known for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 large skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry paste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons tandoori masala</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat butter and vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, onion, and garlic. <br> Cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, <br> curry paste, curry powder, tandoori masala, and garam masala until no lumps of tomato paste remain.</li>
        <li>Pour mixture into a slow cooker; stir in cardamom pods, coconut milk, and yogurt. Season with salt.</li>
        <li>Cook on High for 4 to 6 hours (or on Low for 6 to 8 hours) until chicken is tender and sauce has <br> reduced to desired consistency. Remove and discard cardamom pods before serving.</li>
